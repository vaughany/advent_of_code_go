# Advent of Code, in Go

I've attempted [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) every year since it's creation in a variety of languages and with varying degrees of success, but at the time of writing, I'm all about [Go](https://go.dev).

This repo is my attempt to split out the Go attempts (my current language of choice) from all the other languages I've used (which are [still available elsewhere](https://github.com/vaughany/advent_of_code) and create one application which handles all the days from all the years of the challenges.

One of the things I did not do early on was to always parse the input files - sometimes, with the more complex files, it was easier to dump it all into a string or two within the code and work with that.  But now, I have the input files in 'inputs/' and will endeavour to parse the file no matter how complex it is.
